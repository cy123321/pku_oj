the state of Louisiana is actually shrinking by 50 square miles each year

Input

The first line of input will be a positive integer indicating 
how many data sets will be included (N). 
Each of the next N lines will contain the X and Y Cartesian coordinates of the land 
Fred is considering. These will be floating point numbers measured in miles. 
The Y coordinate will be non-negative. (0,0) will not be given.

Output

For each data set, a single line of output should appear. 
This line should take the form of: ¡°Property N: This property will begin eroding in year Z.¡± 
Where N is the data set (counting from 1), and Z is the first year (start from 1) 
this property will be within the semicircle AT THE END OF YEAR Z. Z must be an integer. 
After the last data set, this should print out ¡°END OF OUTPUT.¡±

Sample Input

2
1.0 1.0
25.0 0.0

Sample Output

Property 1: This property will begin eroding in year 1.
Property 2: This property will begin eroding in year 20.
END OF OUTPUT.

Hint

1.No property will appear exactly on the semicircle boundary: it will either be inside or outside. 
2.This problem will be judged automatically. 
  Your answer must match exactly, including the capitalization, punctuation, and white-space. 
  This includes the periods at the ends of the lines. 
3.All locations are given in miles.

attention!!!
semicircle.....
